The remainder of this document serves as a general Introduction to Robert "The R.A.T." Allen Turner, Zombie Software Systems, Binary Systems, GIMEchip.com and The Little Engineers ( http://www.TheLittleEngineers.org/). Please note that the GIMEchip.com domain was acquired by Robert "The R.A.T." Allen Turner on December 25, 2018 from the prior owners, which happen to be his brother (J.R. a.k.a. John Robert a.k.a. "Big John") and nephew (J.E. a.k.a. John Eric a.k.a. "Little John"). As such, "The R.A.T." is unable to answer any inquiries regarding any products or services of GIMEchip.com prior to that date. "The R.A.T." also acquired the rights to all products previously produced by GIMEchip.com and its previous owners. Those products will all be released as open source, under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International(CC BY-SA 4.0) License, as time and resources permit.

Introducing "The R.A.T.": I have started writing this introduction numerous times only to get sidetracked and derailed. Hopefully, I will be able to properly introduce myself this time. I will start at the beginning of my computer usage. This would be March 30, 1982. My fourteenth birthday. My parents presented me with a Timex Sinclair 1000 (TS1000) computer, after much begging and pleading. The TS1000 is a ZX81 with a few differences: 2K of RAM, an [ENTER] key instead of [NEW LINE] or [N/L] and Timex branding. I had wanted a computer for so long, and Sir Clive Sinclair succeeded in making it affordable. Timex made it even more affordable as the TS1000 was placed on sale for $59.99 at the local "Big B" drug store, at the time, a division of Brunos Corporation (Food World, Food Fair, Consumer Warehouse, etcetera). I was ectstatic - I finally had a computer, limited as it was, I still learned a great deal from that machine and it led to the creation of Zombie Software Systems, my first computer venture. When Timex announced the Timex Sinclair 2068 (TS2068) after cancelling the TS2000 (a 48K Spectrum clone), I knew that I wanted it to be my next computer and my parents agreed to buy it for me for Christmas of 1983. Then, it happened: I walked into the local franchised Radio Shack store, operated at the time by Cisco Auto Parts, and there, on display right next to the entrance, was the newly introduced Color Computer 2 with 16K and Extended Color BASIC. It took mere moments for me to fall in love with that machine and I asked my parents for the Color Computer 2 instead of the TS2068. They placed it on lay-a-way as Christmas approached. It was eventually paid off and sat under the Christmas tree until Christmas Evening of 1983. They allowed me to open it on Christmas Evening and I was up all night working through the programs in the manuals. It was wonderful. This led to the creation of Binary Systems, my second computer venture. Eventually, I came across an advertisement in Radio-Electronics from a company by the name of Unicorn Electronics. They had a set of 4164 Dynamic RAM chips with a 150nS access time for, I think $9.95. The chips were used but tested. I ordered them, along with a bag of keyboard switches (intended to be used for buildinmg a better keyboard for my TS1000). When they arrived, I opened the case of my Color Computer 2, installed the 64K chips, soldered in the W1 jumper and voila - I had a 64K ECB Color Computer 2. Although other systems of the time had better graphics and sound, the Color Computer line of systems by Radio Shack, a division of Tandy Corporation, would become (and remain) my favorite computers of all time. In fact, I still use them to this very day, having kept one Color Computer 3 (CoCo 3) when I passed my vintage computing collection to my brother, J.R. (John Robert) who then passed it on to his son, "Little John" (John Eric), but I will get to that after a brief reminiscence of ZSS and BS, as follows:
ZSS or Zombie Software Systems:

Zombie Software Systems was formed on my fourteenth birthday, 30 March 1982, as a sole proprietorship supporting the Timex and Sinclair computer systems. Supported systems initially included:
Sinclair ZX80
Sinclair ZX81
Timex Sinclair 1000
Support was eventually added for:
Timex Sinclair 1500
The PC-8300 "Your Computer"
Sinclair Spectrum (All Versions)
Timex Sinclair 2068
Sinclair QL
By 1991, and in conjunction with Binary Systems, support had been added for machines from Mattel, Atari, Tomy, Texas Instruments, Tandy Radio Shack, Commodore and many others.

BS or Binary Systems:

Binary Systems was formed on 23 December 1983, as a sole proprietorship supporting the Tandy Radio Shack computer systems. Supported systems initially included:
TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo 1)
Tandy Data Products TDP-100
TRS-80 Color Computer 2 (CoCo 2)
Dragon Data Dragon 32
Tano Dragon 64
TRS-80 Model I
Support was eventually added for:
TRS-80 Model III
TRS-80 Model IV
TRS-80 Model 4/4P
Tandy Color Computer 3
By 1991, and in conjunction with Zombie Software Systems, support had been added for machines from Mattel, Atari, Tomy, Texas Instruments, Sinclair, Commodore, Amstrad, Kaypro and many others. The operation of Zombie Software Systems and Binary Systems was a labor of love more than anything else, as it never made a profit, but it was fun and remains among the best memories of my youth and early adulthood and I am thankful that the stroke (see below) did not take these memories from me.

I continued to support these vintage machines until 2007 when I suffered a stroke. At that point, I passed operations on to my son, John (he and his cousin share both the same name and same date of birth through a very odd coincidence). My son eventually made a mess of things and finally moved on to other hobbies. A side effect of the stroke was that I lost all interest in computers and electronics, vintage and otherwise. It was thus that I presented my entire collection of vintage computers and electronics to my brother J.R. (John Robert or "Big John"). He took the opportunity to bond with his son, J.E. (John Eric or "Little John"). "Little John" was facing a number of health issues, but he jumped in with both feet, teaching himself all about the Color Computer and other systems. He began to develop a plethora of hardware projects for the Color Computer and other vintage systems. The earliest of his design were rubbish due to his lack of skill, but he appears to have learned rather quickly, producing some amazing designs. I have taken it upon myself to "redo" his earliest works, hopefully producing manufacturable products from them. The first of his designs to receive the "redesign" treatment from me is the "FlexiMIDI" and "FlexiROM" projects. Those two designs were excellent in concept, but rubbish in practice due to his lack of circuit design skills at the time that he developed them. They are certainly worth the time and effort to redesign. He would eventually become disillusioned and abandon the hobby altogether. This was, in no small part, due to hackers repeatedly taking down his website: GIMEchip.com. They (the unknown hackers) eventually compromised his eBay and PayPal accounts, rendering them completely useless. That was the straw that broke the camels back, so to speak. He ("Little John") gave up and moved to Tennessee. He left everything with his father, my brother, and asked that his father release all of his works as open source. J.R. made several valiant efforts to honor that request, but never fully succeeded in releasing all of the works of "Little John". Fast Forward almost a decade...

The Beginning of a Family Tragedy:
November of 2018, my father fell ill and was hospitalized. As Christmas approached, he remained in the hospital. Many family members visited and it came to pass that I reconnected with J.R. and "Little John". They asked me if I would like to have my old vintage computing collection back. At first, I was hesitant and uninterested. As my fathers condition worsened, I began to remember how hard my father worked to buy me those first computers. Tons of memories, good and bad, began to flood my mind. I decided to accept their offer. In addition to the hardware and software, they presented me with the GIMEchip.com domain name. This became my Christmas present from my brother and his son. "Little John" asked that I finish what his father started: the release of all of "Little John's" work as open source. I reluctantly agreed, though I was unsure if I could ever manage the time and effort to do so. I honestly was not prepared to take on such a monumental task. Then, tragedy struck.

On the day of January 4, 2019, my father died as I held his hand in that hospital room. His death had quite a profound effect on me. I almost lost my job while trying to come to terms with never being able to speak to my father again. I eventually began to recover, to an extent, but I began to think of everything and everyone that I had lost over the years. For one thing, my own son, also named John Eric Turner, and I are estranged. We "speak" online, but I have not seen him in a very long time. He was unable to be at the hospital and did not get to say goodbye to my father before he died. As mentioned, my son and his cousin are both named John Eric Turner, and there is a story behind it, however, for the moment, suffice it to say that they both were named In Memory of Jon-Erik Hexum, who died on the set of "Cover Up" on Friday, October 12, 1984. As my mind wandered, I thought of my mother in law, Sarah Ann Channell, who passed away on January 12, 2003 and my father in law, Frank Leon Channell, who passed away on August 23, 2003. Even though I was divorced from their daughter, they were still family and their deaths were very painful to me and my son. Indeed, their deaths affected my son in such a way that he never fully recovered and that is partially what eventually led to our falling out in 2007 or 2008 and the resulting estrangement. I am sure that my addled state after that stroke also played a hand in the troubles between my son and I because I became very difficult to be around. Thinking about Sarah and Frank caused me to really begin missing my son and, even more, my father. I then thought about my best friend from high school, David Ray Poe, who died on May 20, 2013. Eight days prior to his death, he had sent me an email that I did not see until after he died. That email was a single sentence: "Did you die?". You can perhaps imagine the effect that reading the message had on me. In reality, he would often send a message like that when he had not heard from me in a while. Another close friend from high school, Steve Allen cox, died on September 6, 2016. As all of the thoughts of everything and everyone that I had lost flooded my mind, I began to spiral and was in peril of losing myself. I needed a distraction, something to keep my mind occupied and perhaps aid in my coming to terms with the death of my father. I found that distraction in the form of that vintage computing collection and the projects that "Little John" had created. It is for that reason alone that you are now reading this and seeing those products, which I have decided to release under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International(CC BY-SA 4.0) License. What this means is that you, or anyone else for that matter, can use the products in almost any way that you may desire, even commercially. I am doing all of this to honor the memory of my father, Robert Embry Turner, and everyone else that I have lost. I truly hope that these products provide much enjoyment to all who discover them. I should point out that I have absolutely no desire to revive the GIMEchip.com website, primarily because I do not have all of the files necessary to recreate GIMEchip.com. It is very likely that I will stumble across some or all of the GIMEchip.com website files as I begin to inventory everything that was included with my 2018 Christmas gift from "Big and Little John". I also DO NOT wish to invoke the ire of those hackers who targeted my nephew and destroyed his website, eBay and PayPal accounts. I will very likely, however, forward the GIMEchip.com domain to a page on my http://www.TheLittleEngineers.org/website or perhaps I will forward it to the GitHub page - I am currently undecided.

So, there you have it - most of what I wanted to say about how I came to posses all of the works of my nephew and his father, as well as their domain name, GIMEchip.com. In addition to releasing all of their products under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International(CC BY-SA 4.0) License, I will also be releasing all of the Zombie Software Systems and Binary Systems products under identicallicensingterms. As I said, I am primarily doing all of this to keep my mind occupied. I miss my Father more than any words, written or spoken, could possibly express and I keep breaking down, crying like an infant. Focusing on these projects has helped more than I could ever have imagined possible. Rest In PeaceDAD, I Love and Miss You. I wanted to do something to honor my father and to keep his memory alive. Thus, in honor of my Father, Robert Embry Turner and all of the others that I have lost, I will be releasing hundreds of products developed by myself and/or my son, my nephew "Little John" and/or his father, Zombie Software Systems and Binary Systems under an open source license, specifically the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International(CC BY-SA 4.0) License. I have absolutely no intention of charging any fees whatsoever in regards to the use of these products. Anyone who so desires may manufacture and sell any of these products, though they must state specifically that they will be providing any and all support as may be required. However, If you would care to support my work, donations are happily accepted, whether they be in the form of funds, vintage computing equipment, tools, components, etcetera. I am always in need of such items. I specifically need PAL versions of the TRS80 Color Computer series (1,2 and 3) as well as NTSC/PAL Dragon D32, D64, D200, etcetera for developmental purposes. Monetary donations help to support the hosting needs of http://www.TheLittleEngineers.org/ as well as the development and manufacture of the prototype Printed Circuit Boards.

Archive name: "TheLittleEngineers.org-27C512E-TO-2532S-V1R1.20.APRIL.2019"

This is an update to the "TheLittleEngineers.org-27C512E-TO-2532S-V1R0.20.APRIL.2019" repository which resides at this url:
https://github.com/TheLittleEngineers/27C512E-TO-2532S-V1R0
This update was made due to the fact that I was not very pleased with the initial Printed Circuit Boards that resulted from the original design. Although functional, the production of the Printed Circuit Boards was inconsistent between different manufacturers. This was due to a problem in the dimension layer of the original design and so I have created this new design to eliminate the inconsistencies.

This version should provide much better results.

Please note: This is derived from an original design by "Little" John Eric and/or his father "Big" John Robert (J.R.) by "Uncle" Robert Allen. It should be thoroughly scrutinized and verified prior to actual use of any kind. DISCLAIMER: The following article is provided for informational purposes only.
