This update was made due to the fact that I was not very pleased with the initial Printed Circuit Boards that resulted from the original design. Although functional, the production of the Printed Circuit Boards was inconsistent between different manufacturers. This was due to a problem in the dimension layer of the original design and so I have created this new design to eliminate the inconsistencies.

This version should provide much better results.
